AutoMate is an app to help keep track of your car's maintenance schedule and service history. I am expecting to have this out by the end of Fall 2020 ðŸ¤ž.

If you're interested in downloading and using the TestFlight beta builds, feel free to check it out here: [https://testflight.apple.com/join/WwJH6tyO](https://testflight.apple.com/join/WwJH6tyO)

I'll update this post as I continue to make more progress on the app. 

### Plans and features
Once complete you should be able to add your car(s) and add in your car's full service history. All backed up using iCloud/CloudKit. 

Target OS: iOS 14+ 

* Add your car(s)

* Track the service history
    * Store previous and current service records for your car.
