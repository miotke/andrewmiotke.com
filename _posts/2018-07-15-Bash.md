I've been on vacation for the past week and a half and I met some really awesome people on the trip. Along with my dedication to Swift I also need to learn Bash and scripting within Bash.

That being said, there's a new repo on my Github profile named `Learning-Bash`. This repo will be just like the `Learning-Swift` repo that I've been working on for so long with various Swift projects, just this time with Bash. If you have any good resources please let me know and I'll be sure to take a look at them.

As for the people I met - it might open some great opportunities that I can't talk about just yet.
