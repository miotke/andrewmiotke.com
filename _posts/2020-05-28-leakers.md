First things first, I'll glance at leaks of products when they blitz past my screen. As someone who has always followed tech, of course I'm interested in knowing what's going to be released soon. 

## Reporters
I want to take this moment though to speak about what _I_ find so troubling about "professional" leakers. There’s been a lot of them over the years and most noticeable are the ones that focus on Apple. Lately however, there’s been an influx of people who have had incredible track records of getting this information correct. I would assume they’re getting this information from someone inside the company(I’ll get to that later) and then sharing said information when they need a social media boost. 

Those reporting(it’s hard to call it reporting) on this information are taking this information and sharing it with the world. I’m not really sure what the benefit of it is though. I don’t think the excuse of “It helps the consumer in their buying decision” holds a ton of water. 

Ultimately though it takes away from those who are working on whatever has been leaked and reported, and that sucks. I’ll come to this more at the end but I think it’s super important.
