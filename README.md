A personal site documenting my experiences and programming.

This site is built using Jekyll and hosted on GHPages. So nothing fancy just a few overrides on the layout.
I plan to keep this simple but open source. There's not a good reason to have this project closed source. 

## posts, includes, layouts
These directories create what makes up the site.

## apps
This directory will hold the app info pages for any iOS apps that I build and release to
the App Store.

## Documentation 
### Run local server
Building the site locally is fairly simple, just run the following: 

`bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental`

The incremental flag allows you to make changes without re-running the server.
