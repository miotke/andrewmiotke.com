A personal site documenting my experiences and programming.

This site is built using Jekyll and hosted on GHPages. So nothing fancy just a few overrides on the layout.
I plan to keep this simple but open source. There's not a good reason to have this project closed source. 

Documentation can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/miotke/andrewmiotke.com/wiki).

As of August 12, 2021 the "primary" branch has been renamed to `main`.
