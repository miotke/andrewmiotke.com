# Taking Classes
Well it's that time again, it's time to start looking at taking a new class to continue to grow my fundamentals in programming. This time I found a class at the Univeristy of Washington(UW) and the course is in Python 🐍!

Python is a language that I've wanted to learn for awhile now, once I had an understanding of Swift. I applied for the class last week and I'm just waiting to get the "acceptance letter". I plan on using this site to write about my experience and to write about what I learn. I'm trying to commit to writing each week 😬🤞.

If you're reading this and are interested in the class, here's the link: [Certification in Python Programming](https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/python-programming)
