    <p>I have decided I want to write more. I’m just not sure what, if any, focus I want to have with it. Tech will be the primary focus leaning toward writing code and other tech opinions that come to mind.</p>

<p>This post is my attempt at getting back into writing. In typical form, I found myself sitting down with a cup coffee yesterday morning ready to go. Then I thought about a problem I had and wrote a Python script to solve that problem. A classic procrastination moment for me, sit down to write a post and instead write some code to solve such a minor problem to begin writing. Always need more tooling :eye-roll:.</p>

<p>So what did that script do? It was simple, I wanted a script that would take an argument as the post title, create the markdown file, get the system date and time, and stuff all of that in the appropriate meta-data/front matter locations. This site is built on Jekyll and Jekyll uses some meta-data at the top of each post called “front matter”. This front matter contains a bunch of information about the post, things like what category the post is related to, the date in which it was created, and the title. Yes, of course I could have just copy and pasted a previous post and filled that front matter in accordingly but, there’s no fun in that and I always found myself making simple mistakes. So I decided to make it significantly more complicated and automate it.</p>

<p>Since creating the markdown file and updating the front matter worked pretty well, I decided to become even lazier and have the script handle all the git commands as well. I’m very particular when it comes to version control, it might be a fault at this point. I want to create a new branch with the post title and push that branch to GitHub. The command being used to create the new branch and check it out is <code class="highlighter-rouge">git push origin master:[new branch name]</code>. If you want to see the script you can find it <a href="https://github.com/miotke/andrewmiotke.com/blob/master/new_post.py">here</a>.</p>

<p>So far this script is working exactly as I would expect. It even gave me the added bonus(?) of allowing me to procrastinate on actual writing and instead, write some code.</p>
