# andrewmiotke.com

A personal site documenting my experiences and programming.

This site is built using Jekyll, so nothing fancy just a few overrides on the layout.
I plan to keep this simple but open to the public because there's not a good reason to have
it public right now.

## posts, includes, layouts
These directories create what makes up the site.

## apps
This directory will hold the app info pages for any iOS apps that I build and release to
the App Store.

## Other stuff

### Building the site
Run server locally: 
`bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental`
