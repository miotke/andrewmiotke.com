The rule of thumb I‚Äôve always been given is keep it short and sweet and try to keep it all on one page. In today‚Äôs world we rarely stay at a company for more than three or four years, how are we supposed to keep all this work experience limited one page? Especially when you have to include tings like education, and typically a quick synopsis of who you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I took my boring, plain text resum√© and made it into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub Gist&lt;/a&gt;. I found this to be a really compelling way to keep my resume concise and formatted in a way that is visually appealing. Since it‚Äôs just a Gist you can view it in your browser, it‚Äôs formatted in markdown so it‚Äôs easy on the eyes, and you can update it easily. It also looks like it‚Äôs just on one really long page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;readability&quot;&gt;Readability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far too often when reading resum√©s you get a white paper with a black wall of text. It‚Äôs not easy to read and can be one of the most draining processes, at least for me. Using markdown breaks up the text and has a native font that is easy on the eyes and can be easily read. I think this is a great alternative to the classic Times New Roman font that we so often see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;editable&quot;&gt;Editable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A traditional resum√© is not particularly easy to edit. You might run into problems like formatting, fighting your text editor, and just having a safe place to store your resum√©. On top of all that, you have keep and editable version of it and a pdf version, so now you‚Äôre playing around with maintaining two different versions of your resum√©. Using a GitHub Gist allows you to leave all of that behind‚Ä¶well except for using markdown syntax, but that is quick to pickup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Gist is simply just a markdown file and GitHub will host and present it for you. Formatting is simple once you get the hang of the markdown syntax. The only tool you have to really ‚Äúfight‚Äù is GitHub‚Äôs markdown editor which is pretty straight forward to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part though, is versioning. GitHub will track any revisions you make to the Gist just like your code. GitHub will present in a clean markdown format and they will give you a link to easily share, it couldn‚Äôt be easier. This means you don‚Äôt have to worry about keeping an editable version that you constantly update and then a pdf version of that to share out. Just give them the link to your Gist and you can edit as you need to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;short-comings&quot;&gt;Short Comings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are downsides however, most places you apply for ask for you to upload a pdf version of your resum√© so I still keep a current version of that resum√© on hand. If an employer wants to see a more elaborate and detailed version of the resume, well this Gist will be a great addition to the pdf resum√©.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;final-thought&quot;&gt;Final Thought&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt know if this will ever catch on but I think it would be a great transition when applying for a job or just trying to share out your experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out my Resum√© Gist &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/miotke/4f25049cee4c422c63dc94257ce3b2aa&quot;&gt;here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well it‚Äôs that time again, it‚Äôs time to start looking at taking a new class to continue to grow my fundamentals in programming. This time I found a class at the Univeristy of Washington(UW) and the course is in Python üêç!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python is a language that I‚Äôve wanted to learn for awhile now, once I had an understanding of Swift. I applied for the class last week and I‚Äôm just waiting to get the ‚Äúacceptance letter‚Äù. I plan on using this site to write about my experience and to write about what I learn. I‚Äôm trying to commit to writing each week üò¨ü§û.&lt;/p&gt;

Today I‚Äôm going to explain the vision and purpose of why this website exists in the first place and what I hope to achieve with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;vision&quot;&gt;Vision&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My vision for this website is to have a place that I can talk about my various learnings with Swift and other topics as I explore iOS development and developing on Apple platforms. Along with this I hope to show case and promote other people who are contributing to the Swift community as I find their articles, podcasts, or even a repo on Github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;purpose&quot;&gt;Purpose&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in the &lt;em&gt;Vision&lt;/em&gt; section above I want to promote the work of other contributors in the Swift community, people such as Sean Allen on Youtube or Zack and Steve from the &lt;em&gt;Fireside Swift&lt;/em&gt; podcasts(I‚Äôll link to those resources at the bottom). I believe that if I can help promote them with the potential readers of this site then that will grant them more exposure and they can continue doing the great work that they‚Äôre doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other purpose of this is to have a sound board that I can write about topics related to Swift. I‚Äôve only been writing Swift for a short time now but I‚Äôm enjoying it more and more with ever line I write. If I have a place I can write about Swift then it will help me solidify those concepts and maybe help someone else who is in the learning process as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all comes down to helping others if at all possible. If I can (hopefully)write something interesting or teachable to others and give thanks to others who are contributing great content to the Swift community then the purpose of this site has been achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;contributor-thanks&quot;&gt;Contributor Thanks&lt;/h1&gt;

Over the last eight months I made the decision to leave what I thought my dreams were, web development(yet here we are on a website) to pursue what I quickly learn was a true passion of mine, iOS development with Swift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-happened-with-web&quot;&gt;What happened with web?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I learned after spending too much time that I didn‚Äôt care enough. It wasn‚Äôt that it was hard, or the job market wasn‚Äôt flourishing - because it is and still is. I left the &lt;em&gt;dream&lt;/em&gt; of becoming a web developer because I wasn‚Äôt having fun with it. Full transparency, I never achieved a career or was offered a job as a web developer. I didn‚Äôt even work that hard in my spare time to study languages like JavaScript, it just didn‚Äôt interest me enough. To this day I still think it‚Äôs incredible what can be done in a browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the craft of the web is fascinating and I have the up most respect for developers out there that work so hard to create the sites we all enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-swift-why-the-world-of-ios-development&quot;&gt;Why Swift, why the world of iOS Development?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep down I have always been an Apple nerd or as some call it a fanboy so turning to iOS development seemed like an easy decision to make. Before Swift, back when Objective-C was the language of the iPhone I worked as a Genius at Apple in the Tacoma Mall store, in fact I helped open that store and was one of the original employees there which was one of the coolest experiences of my life to date. However, as an Apple employee you can‚Äôt submit apps to the app store which discouraged me all those years ago(maybe time for a policy change Apple?). I was interested in iOS development during those days but didn‚Äôt write a line of Objective-C until years later when I picked up my first book. They say Objective-C is scary and a tough language to break into, I agreed and went back to the web(see above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years and two companies later I read a blog post by one of the iOS developers at my current company and something clicked then. They talked about battery life and how to optimize the app with battery capacity in mind, that peaked my interest of programming and really manipulating how a ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù works. I think working on core OS level code is really cool as it has to talk so cohesively with the hardware(mixing in with my current IT life). So I starting reading &lt;em&gt;Hacking With Swift&lt;/em&gt; and worked through that book on my long commute home from Seattle, I was immediately hooked on it. I‚Äôm still in the learning phases and I plan on using this site to expand my knowledge by writing various posts about specific topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-am-i-doing-current&quot;&gt;What am I doing current?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently I‚Äôm still working in the IT industry as a Sys Admin/Support Specialist(we do a lot of things, it‚Äôs a mixed bag). I‚Äôve learned a lot, met a lot of great people, and got my hands on a lot of new toys before anyone else. However, that time is over and I am diving head first into a programming career. I commute from download Seattle to Tacoma every day so I‚Äôve been using this time to work on Swift or work on this website but, it‚Äôs finally time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Welcome to andrewmiotke.com v2.0, if you saw my previous website then you know it was aimed at being a web developer, this is taking a whole new turn.
