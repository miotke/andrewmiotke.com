I"É<p>Iâ€™ve been on vacation for the past week and a half and I met some really awesome people on the trip. Along with my dedication to Swift I also need to learn Bash and scripting within Bash.</p>

<p>That being said, thereâ€™s a new repo on my Github profile named <code class="highlighter-rouge">Learning-Bash</code>. This repo will be just like the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Learning-Swift</code> repo that Iâ€™ve been working on for so long with various Swift projects, just this time with Bash. If you have any good resources please let me know and Iâ€™ll be sure to take a look at them.</p>

<p>As for the people I met - it might open some great opportunities that I canâ€™t talk about just yet.</p>
