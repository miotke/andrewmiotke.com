<p>Well it’s that time again, it’s time to start looking at taking a new class to continue to grow my fundamentals in programming. This time I found a class at the Univeristy of Washington(UW) and the course is in Python 🐍!</p>

<p>Python is a language that I’ve wanted to learn for awhile now, once I had an understanding of Swift. I applied for the class last week and I’m just waiting to get the “acceptance letter”. I plan on using this site to write about my experience and to write about what I learn. I’m trying to commit to writing each week 😬🤞.</p>

<p>If you’re reading this and are interested in the class, here’s the link: <a href="https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/python-programming">Certification in Python Programming</a></p>
