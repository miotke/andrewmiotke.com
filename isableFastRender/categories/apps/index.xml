      <description>Introducing Tankd, my first iOS app released in the App Store for iOS!
So the app is called Tankd and simply put itâ€™s a fuel stop tracking app for iOS. I had heard a few times and even talked to a few friends who like to save their receipts at every fuel stop they make. I tried this for a short bit and got frustrated with all of the receipt papers cluttering up areas like the glove box.</description>
