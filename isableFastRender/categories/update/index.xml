      <description>I have decided I want to write more. I&amp;rsquo;m just not sure what, if any, focus I want to have with it. Tech will be the primary focus leaning toward writing code and other tech opinions that come to mind.
This post is my attempt at getting back into writing. In typical form, I found myself sitting down with a cup coffee yesterday morning ready to go. Then I thought about a problem I had and wrote a Python script to solve that problem.</description>

      <description>I finally did it! Earlier this week I submitted an app to TestFlight for the first time. This is the first step in achieving my goal of submitting an app to the iOS App Store and I could not be more excited. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk more about the app in a moment with a link so you can download it. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to let it bake with testers in TestFlight to work out all the kinks and bugs then move it to the App Store soon.</description>

      <description>Update As I outlined in A New Hope I&amp;rsquo;m taking this time to refocus my software development efforts on iOS and Swift. It&amp;rsquo;s been about a week and a half since I was laid off of my job and I have taken it in stride. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to work on a few different types of apps, some &amp;ldquo;portfolio&amp;rdquo; that won&amp;rsquo;t be released on the App Store and at least one that will be released on the App Store.</description>

      <description>After nearly three years I was let go and lost my job due to the COVID-19 pandemic, yeah, it sucks&amp;hellip;hard. I&amp;rsquo;m now unemployed but thankfully I have a tremendous and supportive wife, family and friends. I really have no idea where I would be without them.
The breakup I found out at the same time as many of my colleagues, Slack exploded and Notification Center on my Mac was trying to keep up.</description>

      <description>In my last post I explained my journey up to this point in time and my found passion for Swift. Today I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain the vision and purpose of why this website exists in the first place and what I hope to achieve with it.
Vision My vision for this website is to have a place that I can talk about my various learnings with Swift and other topics as I explore iOS development and developing on Apple platforms.</description>

      <description>Welcome to andrewmiotke.com v2.0, if you saw my previous website then you know it was aimed at being a web developer, this is taking a whole new turn. Over the last eight months I made the decision to leave what I thought my dreams were, web development(yet here we are on a website) to pursue what I quickly learn was a true passion of mine, iOS development with Swift.
What happened with web?</description>
