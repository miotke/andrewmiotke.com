<p>As I outlined in <a href=http://andrewmiotke.com/update/2020/03/31/a-new-hope.html>A New Hope</a> I&rsquo;m taking
this time to refocus my software development efforts on iOS and Swift. It&rsquo;s been about a week and a half
since I was laid off of my job and I have taken it in stride. I&rsquo;ve decided to work on a few different types of
apps, some &ldquo;portfolio&rdquo; that won&rsquo;t be released on the App Store and at least one that will be released on the App Store.</p>
<h3 id=introducing-meal-time>Introducing: Meal Time<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introducing-meal-time>#</a></h3>
<p>Meal Time is the first &ldquo;portfolio&rdquo; app that I&rsquo;ve built during this jobless time. I started this idea some time ago
but never &ldquo;finished&rdquo; it until now(finished is in quotes because there&rsquo;s always things I could change).</p>
<p>I was curious how the whole app ecosystem worked, that being a web api and mobile app. I used the Django
REST framework to build the api and hosted that api was deployed to Heroku&rsquo;s free tier. I then build an iOS app using Swift to consume the data this api was serving.
The app would display the menu title, price, and a description then display it in the app. I used a simple root view and detail view
to navigate around and get more information.</p>
<p>If you look at the detail view, all the meal UILabels including the UIImage(it&rsquo;s just an emoji) are all populated
by data coming from the Django REST api.</p>
<p>If you would like to check it out in more detail feel free to head over to the <a href=https://github.com/miotke/MealTime>Meal Time</a> repository on GitHub.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This app is not fully featured and will not actually order anything üòâ</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
