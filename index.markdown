Hi, I'm Andrew a software developer writing Swift and Python in Tacoma, WA.
Feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/miotke) or on [Github](https://github.com/miotke).
If you're interested in seeing my resume, check out my [Resume Gist](https://gist.github.com/miotke/4f25049cee4c422c63dc94257ce3b2aa).
I'm mostly interested in writing Swift and Python but I'm always interested in learning a new technology or language.

I rarely write but when I do you can find those below ðŸ‘‡.
