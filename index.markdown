Hi, I'm Andrew a software developer writing Swift and Python in Tacoma, WA.
Feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/miotke) or on [Github](https://github.com/miotke).
If you're interested in seeing my resume, you can find it [here](https://andrewmiotke.com/resume.html).
I'm mostly interested in writing Swift and Python but I'm always interested in learning a new technology or language. Click Apps at the top to view the apps that have been released onto the App Store ‚§¥Ô∏è.

I rarely write but when I do you can read it below üëá.
